            "Aboutme":"My name is Keenan Timmie I am an aspiring developer currently studying at Life Choices Academy I would say I am a junior developer, I started dabbling in coding from 14 just simple stuff at first never took CAT or anything like that so I had to teach myself. After a while I gradually tried harder and harder coding languages I would describe myself as a hard worker and an ambitious SOB (Son of a Birch) Nothing's ever enough for me, The road to success is not a road, but a ladder all that matters is climbing higher and higher until you reach the top. in my spare time I like to read history, play games read novels and code. I would like to say I'm a people person but that'd be a fib and that's illegal (I think). Honestly if I could just summarise as to what my goals are is that I want to be an example, coming from a hopeless suburb (Mitchells Plain) where people think everyone is lazy and useless I want to prove them wrong and I want to prove to the people of Mitchells Plain that through hard work and dedication you CAN have better conditions (also better hair)."
