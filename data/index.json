I've been interested in computers ever since I can remember I must've been age 4 when I first started actively using computers. Ever since I always knew that my job had to do with computers in someway or another."

    "AboutMeText":"My story is somewhat common I would think. I am from Colorado Park, Mitchell's Plain. Not a nice area but hey beggars can't be choosers as they say. I started coding when i was around 12 my reasoning being was that I wanted to see how games worked. Looked it up and saw something called programming which looked like a foreign language to me. (Still does) And then kinda coded on and off. Self teaching myself with the Unity Game Engine, doing html and css on the side. Learning C# never got around to 3D modeling so all my playermodels were cylinders."

   "AboutMeText":"Ever since I was in High School I felt like such a let down. I didn't get that good of grades I mean I didn't get zeroes and ones, I was very average but I always wanted to be more than average. I just wanted to show the world I can do it that I will do it. I've found my passion which is programming and I am willing to go as far as I need to to achieve my aspirations. I want to be the outlier. Where i'm from you're not supposed to 'make it' you just settle for a retail job or a cleaner or whatever and that's it that's what you get if you're from Mitchell's Plain. I want to break that. I want to be a leader I want people from my area to go 'He can make it so can I'."
